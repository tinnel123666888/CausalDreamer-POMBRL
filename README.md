Official implementation of the paper:

**Causal Dreamer for Partially Observable Model-Based Reinforcement Learning**  
(*Under Review*)  

## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository contains the code and experimental setup for our proposed **Causal Dreamer** framework, which improves model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) in partially observable environments by integrating counterfactual inference for history compression and long-term reasoning.

Key contributions:

- A causality-based model that filters historical observations via **history counterfactual inference**.
- A **coarse-to-fine intervention strategy** that reduces computational overhead in causal mining.
- A variant of the Dreamer algorithm enhanced with causal memory selection, achieving superior performance in long-horizon, memory-dependent tasks.
